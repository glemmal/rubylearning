# Code Reviews

Code Reviews are a form of static testing. You can find a quite [comprehensive overview about them in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review).

For reviewing the code of your peers, I suggest you consider the following questions:

* The code examples in the spec files are meant to give you a quick way to learn and understand the basics of ruby. Thus, the focus of the review is not so much on finding bugs but more on wether the code snippets really help with that:
* are the titels of the examples helpful? As you can put any strings there, you can explain what your doing/showing there.
* are all questions you had regarding that specific topic answered?
* If not, you might want to add more examples.
